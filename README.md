# MPCAS

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

I often find I need to do some semi-complicated algebraic manipulations.
A symbolic computer algebra system (CAS) is useful for these situations.
However, I find most CAS software is extremely hard to use for simple operations.
I also want this to be scriptable and "programmable".

I most care about the simple things:

1. Variable substitution
2. Expand terms
3. Collect terms
4. Solve for variable

To get started, all I care about are polynomials.
May include exponential/logarithms in the future.
